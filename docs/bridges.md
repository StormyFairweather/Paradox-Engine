# Bridges (Tier 1.5)

Bridge documents provide conservative, **one-way** correspondences from Paradox Engine (Tier 1 abstractions) to measurable Tier 2 observables. They are intentionally limited: **they do not** derive Hamiltonians or compute eigenvalues. They *map* conceptual operators to physical quantities so experimentalists can design tests and engineers can implement prototypes.

### Available bridges

- [**1.5-Mechanical Bridge.pdf**](bridges/1.5-Mechanical_Bridge.pdf) — Discrete mechanical lattices, phonons, and PE operator correspondences.  
- [**1.5-Quantum Bridge.pdf**](bridges/1.5-Quantum_Bridge.pdf) — Canonical mapping for quantum observables (Tier-1 ↔ Tier-2 correspondences).

## Usage notes

- Bridges are **prescriptive** in language: they define permitted vs forbidden phrasing in downstream claims.  
- Use bridges to determine which experimental signatures are PE-informative and which require conventional physics to quantify.

## Recommended path

1. Read the Mechanical Bridge for immediate lab/test guidance (materials & metamaterials).  
2. Consult the Quantum Bridge when dealing with band topology, TBG, or other quantum observables.
