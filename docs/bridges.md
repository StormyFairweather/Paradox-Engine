# Bridges (Tier 1.5)

Bridge documents provide conservative, **one-way** correspondences from Paradox Engine (Tier 1 abstractions) to measurable Tier 2 observables. They are intentionally limited: **they do not** derive Hamiltonians or compute eigenvalues. They *map* conceptual operators to physical quantities so experimentalists can design tests and engineers can implement prototypes.

### Available bridges

- [**Mechanical Bridge**](bridges/Mechanical_Bridge.pdf) — Discrete mechanical lattices, phonons, and PE operator correspondences.  
- [**Quantum Bridge**](bridges/Quantum_Bridge.pdf) — Canonical mapping for quantum observables.
- [**Thermogravity Bridge**](bridges/Thermogravity_Bridge.pdf) — Mapping for gravitational and entropic effects.
- [**Biological Bridge**](bridges/Biological_Bridge.pdf) — Explanatory mapping for biological systems.
- [**Chemistry Bridge**](bridges/Chemistry_Bridge.pdf) — Mapping for effects that arise from chemical reactions.

## Usage notes

- Bridges are **prescriptive** in language: they define permitted vs forbidden phrasing in downstream claims.  
- Use bridges to determine which experimental signatures are PE-informative and which require conventional physics to quantify.
