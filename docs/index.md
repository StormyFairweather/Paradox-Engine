# Paradox Engine

**An open, multi-tier conceptual framework linking reflexive mathematics with engineered physical systems.**

This site is the public front-door for the Paradox Engine project. It bundles the practical engineering work (materials and prototypes), the Tier-1 core formalism, and the Tier-1.5 bridge documents that map abstract operators to physical observables.

## Quick navigation (suggested reading order)

1. **Applications & Results (Tier 2)** — [Publications & Papers](papers/)  
   Start here if you are looking for applied results, the materials trilogy (nanotubes, graphene, macronanotubes), and experimental protocols.

2. **Core Concepts (Tier 1)** — [Core Expository Documents](core/)  
   The explanatory overlay, and the Rosetta. Conceptual scaffolding and informal explanation.

3. **Bridges (Tier 1.5)** — [Bridges: Mechanical · Quantum](bridges/)  
   One-way correspondences that allow conservative mapping from PE abstractions to measurable physical observables.

## Goals

* Provide a clear, minimal conceptual structure for recurrence and attractor design.  
* Make Tiered mappings understandable and usable for material scientists and engineers.  
* Ship reproducible test protocols and datasets.
