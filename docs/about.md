# About the Paradox Engine Project

**Project lead:** Stormy Fairweather (Paradox Engine Collaborative)

This repository is an open, evolving body of work documenting a multi-tier formalism (PE) and its conservative mappings to experiment and engineering practice. We aim to bridge abstract recurrence theory and pragmatic materials science.

If you are interested in reproductions, collaborations, or code access, open an issue on the GitHub repository.
