# Core Documents (Tier 1)

This section contains the canonical Tier-1 materials: the Mathematical Core and the Rosetta document. These are **interpretive formalism** — they do **not** produce numerical predictions for physical systems by themselves. They provide the vocabulary, symbolic mapping, and a readable translation of the PE math for non-specialists.

### The Rosetta — what it *is*

The Rosetta is intentionally written to translate the PE formalism into language accessible to readers who do not hold advanced formal mathematics degrees. Its purpose is educational and translational: to let engineers, technicians, and broadly trained scientists *understand the conceptual correspondences* without needing to parse the entire Tier-1 symbolic formalism.

- [**Paradox Engine Mathematical Core**](core/Paradox_Engine_Mathematical_Core.pdf) — annotated equations and formal context.  
- [**Paradox Engine Rosetta**](core/Paradox_Engine_Rosetta.pdf) — human-readable translation of core ideas (educational/introductory).

> Read the Rosetta first if you want an accessible entry point. Use the Mathematical Core for deeper symbolic detail.
