# Paradox Engine – Core Repository

The Paradox Engine (PE) is a unified conceptual framework that reframes recurrence, observability,
and physical modeling through a minimal, non-predictive formal structure.

This repository contains:

- **/core**  
  Canonical definitions, the PE Explanatory Overlay, and the Rosetta Stone supplementary explanation of the core concepts in layman's terms.

- **/bridges**  
  Verified Tier-1 → Tier-2 one-way correspondence bridges.

- **/papers**  
  All public publications, including the Rosetta document.

## Project Goals

1. **Provide a clear, minimal conceptual structure** that shows *why* the Paradox Engine works.  
2. **Serve as an anchor point for independent verification and reproduction.**  
3. **Offer a discoverable, linkable, citable public reference** for researchers and technologists.

## What Paradox Engine *Is Not*

- It is **not** a predictive physical theory.  
- It is **not** a computational implementation of emergent consciousness.  
- It does **not** assert ontological claims beyond the minimal formalism.

It is a *lens*—a reversible mapping of conceptual structure to physical intuition that becomes
useful only when understood from first principles.
