# Paradox Engine – Core Repository

The Paradox Engine (PE) is a unified conceptual framework that reframes recurrence, observability,
and physical modeling through a minimal, non-predictive formal structure.

This repository contains:

- **/core**  
  Canonical definitions, the PE Explanatory Overlay, and the Rosetta Stone supplementary explanation of the core concepts in layman's terms.

- **/bridges**  
  Verified Tier-1 → Tier-2 one-way correspondence bridges.

- **/papers**  
  All public publications, including the Rosetta document.
  
Note: The Rosetta is intentionally designed as an accessible translation of the PE formalism for non-specialists. Read it first if you want a clear conceptual entry point.

## Project Goals

1. **Provide a clear, minimal conceptual structure** that shows *why* the Paradox Engine works.  
2. **Serve as an anchor point for independent verification and reproduction.**  
3. **Offer a discoverable, linkable, citable public reference** for researchers and technologists.

## What Paradox Engine *Is Not*

- It is **not** a predictive physical theory.  
- It is **not** a computational implementation of emergent consciousness.  
- It does **not** assert ontological claims beyond the minimal formalism.

It is a *lens*—a reversible mapping of conceptual structure to physical intuition that becomes
useful only when understood from first principles.

## Formal Overview (academic)

The Paradox Engine is a tiered correspondence framework distinguishing:
- **Tier 1:** Formal recurrence algebra and attractor operators (symbolic).  
- **Tier 1.5:** Bridges — conservative one-way mapping rules from Tier 1 abstractions to Tier 2 observables.  
- **Tier 2:** Physical systems (materials, metamaterials, engineered prototypes).

Bridges define the *language* researchers should use when describing PE-pertinent results (permitted phrases, forbidden claims, explicit falsification criteria). Experimental claims must anchor on Tier 2 measurements; Bridges only provide interpretive mappings and testable expectations.

**Repository structure:**
- `/core` — Tier 1 documents (Rosetta; Explanatory Overlay).  
- `/bridges` — Tier 1.5 mapping documents (mechanical & quantum).  
- `/papers` — Tier 2 applied work and reproducible protocols.
